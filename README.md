## BRIDGE

I wrote this when i was in high school. 

don't compile BridgeTester.java. idk what it was supposed to me.


Ariel, you will forget again how to use java

to compile: `javac *.java`
it will have some errors because bridgetester is broken. it'll compile everything else tho.
to run: to run: java Main

super cool! it looks like it works!
